It means that there was no difference in user behavior when landing on an old or new page. To test this, we used the chi-square test (Python function) and the bootstrap test (\"by hand\"). Since the data size was too large, we found a sample size with two methods. Lastly, we checked the influence of other factors such as time and country, but also found no significant effect."
