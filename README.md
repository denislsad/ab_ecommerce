A simple A/B test using Python. The data comes from an e-commerce site, and column names like "landing_page" suggest that there were two versions of a landing page that appears after a user clicks on a link in an email or ad. The "converted" column indicates whether a user took some action after landing on a page. This could be adding an item to a shopping cart or making a purchase. The null hypothesis is that the new website design is not statistically different from the old one.

The test failed to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that there was no difference in user behavior when landing on an old or new page. To test this, we used the chi-square test (Python function) and the bootstrap test ("by hand"). Since the data size was too large, we found a sample size with two methods. Lastly, we checked the influence of other factors such as time and country, but also found no significant effect.
